# User Interface

why Knockout, why not Angular - too complex, swallows/hides binding errors.

* Concept of routes
* Dispatch Routes, mounting of resources. Contextual execution.
* Run in Eclipse - routes and API's in documentation and in browser
* Tests - pages. Referencing of test result objects webtest-result>qualified name, webtest-actor>qualified name, webtest-page>qualified name
* Build
* Browse results. TODO - sequence diagrams and maybe SWF generation for test results
* Mobile
  * Mobile browser - responsive.
  * Hybrid. Subclassing routes to reuse common elements, or agent-based switch. 
  * Native - make API calls.
* Mobile testing
  * Mobile browser - same page classes, maybe modifications in logic to address responsiveness.
  * Hybrid, native - different page classes, but same actors and tests.
* WebSocket example - long running operation with progress feedback.
* Security

[TODO]: # (Story-based entitlements???)

Dynamic proxy NOP_DRIVER to PageFactory – is it worth the trouble?
Tests - @Service to get access to CDO transaction to validate balance?
Rendering:
- Building - HTML library
- Templating - JET - link to Vogella tutorial, old, good, compiles to Java, Java syntax, tool that works, we are not after fancy.
- Interpolation - HTML, mustache syntax `` { { } } `` - chart example from Doc route - script and how it is interpolated (Java code)
- Mix and match - again the chart example and some example with JET.
- Other things - mustach for Java, FreeMarker.
