# User Interface

why Knockout, why not Angular - too complex, swallows/hides binding errors.

* Concept of routes
* Dispatch Routes, mounting of resources. Contextual execution.
* Run in Eclipse - routes and API's in documentation and in browser
* Tests - pages. Referencing of test result objects webtest-result>qualified name, webtest-actor>qualified name, webtest-page>qualified name
* Build
* Browse results. TODO - sequence diagrams and maybe SWF generation for test results
* Mobile
  * Mobile browser - responsive.
  * Hybrid. Subclassing routes to reuse common elements, or agent-based switch. 
  * Native - make API calls.
* Mobile testing
  * Mobile browser - same page classes, maybe modifications in logic to address responsiveness.
  * Hybrid, native - different page classes, but same actors and tests.
* WebSocket example - long running operation with progress feedback.
* Security

[TODO]: # (Story-based entitlements???)
