# Scaling up

## Development 

* Teams, 
* Multiple models, routes, tests - unit, integration. 
* Collection of components (back-end stubs and/or connectors) in shared repositories, 
* Trying new technologies, e.g. new UI framework leveraging existing API's and tests. Or even side-by-side.
* Issue reporting ToolbarContributor, also an issue reporting icon to the app pages.
* New members explore the system. Team visualization or team model? - vendor/contact address
* This book - scaling up knowledge.

## Runtime

* Vertical - DB, Server/Repository, Session provider. HA/Failover - DB, repository. 
* Horizontal -  web containers, haproxy docker container in front. 
* Finer grained - ECF.
* Several linked docker images (Docker compose) - the app, server, db.
* Docker swarm. 

Running in Docker - Add an application with a shutdown hook, modify startup parameters - no console, app. Start as Java, not as executable?
