# Setup

Imagine that our boss told us about an upcoming project to build a prototype of an online/mobile banking self-service application.
He informed us that there will be a meeting set up in a day or so to talk to the business folks and clarify requirements. 
So at this point of time all information we have is a potential application name - ``bank`` or ``self-service``. 
Let's say we've decided to stick with ``bank``. 

So, what do we do at this stage with such limited information available? We will:

* [Install prerequisites](install-prerequisites.md):
  * Java, 
  * Eclipse, 
  * Maven Integration for Eclipse,
  * Tycho Configurator,
  * Nasdanika Application Workspace Wizard and Story Edtor,  
  * Graphviz.
* [Generate application projects](generate-application-projects.md)
* [Run the application in Eclipse](run-application-in-eclipse.md)
* [Build and launch the application locally](build-and-launch-locally.md)
* [Dockerize the application](dockerize.md)
* [Set up an automated build](automated-build.md)
  * Publish code to GitHub,
  * Set up build/test job on CircleCI,
  * Set up automated image build on Docker Hub.
