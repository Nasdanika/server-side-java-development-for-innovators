# Automated Build

By now we know how to build our application locally, now we will automate this process by publishing the code to GitHub, setting a CircleCI build/test job and Docker Hub automated build. 

In your situation you might have to use different version control and build systems and for this reason
I do not provide very detailed descriptions these particular three. 

## GitHub

Publishing to GitHub is a rather straightforward process. This is how it was done for our application:
* I created a repository on GitHub with ``README.md`` file - https://github.com/Nasdanika/bank, and copied repository URL to clipboard.
* Then I opened "Git Repositories" view in Eclipse, clicked the icon "Clone a Git Repository...", and completed the clone wizard.
* Then for each project in the workspace I right-clicked on it, selected Team > Share project, and added the project to the new Git repository.
* Finally, I've marked ``target`` and ``bin`` folders as ignored, added other files to the list of staged changes, committed them and pushed to upstream. 

## Building on CircleCI and publishing to Docker Hub

I already had accounts on CircleCI and Docker Hub. To build our application I had to add ``circle.yml`` file to the root of the repository:

```yml
machine:
  java:
    version: openjdk8
  services:
    - docker
        
dependencies: 
  override:
    - echo 'Skipping Dependency Check'

test:
  pre:
    - wget http://nasdanika.org/winstone-0.9.10.jar
    - cd org.nasdanika.bank.aggregator && mvn package javadoc:aggregate
    
  override:
    - cd org.nasdanika.bank.aggregator && mvn verify
    
  post:
    - java -jar winstone-0.9.10.jar --webroot=org.nasdanika.bank.repository/target/repository --controlPort=8081:
        background: true
    - sleep 5
    - cd org.nasdanika.bank.product.parent && mvn package
    - java -cp winstone-0.9.10.jar winstone.tools.WinstoneControl shutdown
    - docker build -t nasdanika/bank:$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM org.nasdanika.bank.product/target/products/org.nasdanika.bank.product/linux/gtk
    
deployment:
  staging:
    branch: master
    commands:
    - mv org.nasdanika.bank.product/target/products/org.nasdanika.bank.product-*.zip $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS    
    - docker login -e $DOCKER_EMAIL -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS
    - docker push nasdanika/bank:$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM
```

You can see that build steps in the file mirror the manual build steps which we performed in previous sections. 

Also note that our UI tests detect if they run in a headless mode and use PhantomJS driver instead of Firefox driver.
