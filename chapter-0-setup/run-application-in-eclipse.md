# Run the Application in Eclipse


## Cleaning up the product

The wizard generates a feature-based product which includes many plug-ins some of which may not be used by the application. 
The product must be feature based - otherwise Tycho fails to generate Eclipse product with native launch artifacts.

To reduce "noise" in the documentation system caused by unused bundles and packages the application feature
can "cleaned up" by removing unnecessary bundles.
Included feature(s) with unnecessary plug-ins shall be removed, and needed plug-ins from that feature(s) shall be added to the application feature. 
It can be done through the feature editor, but it might be easier to do it at a text level by copying needed plug-in tags from the included feature.xml to the application feature.xml.   

We will do it with the ``org.nasdanika.feature``.

## Start
To run the application in Eclipse we shall open the ``org.nasdanika.bank.product`` file in the ``org.nasdanika.bank.product`` project and click either ``Launch an Eclipse application`` or ``Launch and Eclipse application in Debug mode``.

When the application starts we should see console output similar to the one below:

![Console output](console-output.png)

There is an error message with a stack trace because we don't have test results yet.


## Navigate to the test route
Now when we open ``http://localhost:8080/nasdanika-bank/router/nasdanika-bank.html`` in a Web browser it shall display a welcome message as shown below:

## Navigate to the documentation system
After that we open ``http://localhost:8080/nasdanika-bank/router/doc.html`` and see the Nasdanika Bank Information Center (the documentation system):

## Shutdown

We are done with our initial launch. To gracefully shutdown the application type ``shutdown`` in the console and press <Enter>. Wait for several seconds and if the application does not exit type another command, e.g. ``ss``:

## Summary

By now we have launched our new application from Eclipse IDE and made sure that it works. Launching the application from Eclipse, especially in Debug mode, is the primary way of how developers will use the application.

The next step is to [explore the documentation system](documentation-system-overview.md) so we know how to use it.
