# Summary

Well, it was a long enough chapter. We had only one piece of information as an input - "a web/mobile banking application" and as an output we have an application with no business functionality, but with a documentation system, including JavaDoc with linked sources, and an automated build process which produces an Eclipse product and a Docker image. 

If we had to do it over again, or if we had to generate another application, it wouldn't take a lot of time with all the prerequisites being in place.

In the [next chapter](../chapter-1-user-stories/README.md) we will start working on user stories and initial tests.
